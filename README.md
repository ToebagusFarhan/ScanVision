# ScanVision

**ScanVision** is an innovative application that leverages machine learning to assess and classify eye health conditions quickly and accurately. It caters to both medical professionals and the general public by offering a user-friendly platform for detecting common eye health issues such as Diabetic Retinopathy, Cataract, Myopia, and Dry Eye Irritation.

**For medical professionals**, ScanVision serves as a valuable tool by analyzing funduscopy images to classify the severity of Diabetic Retinopathy. This assists in decision-making and helps prioritize treatment strategies.

**For the general public**, the app provides a convenient way to detect and evaluate the severity of eye health conditions using images captured via mobile devices. Furthermore, it enhances accessibility by offering recommendations for nearby hospitals, guiding users to appropriate medical care based on their results.

By addressing the lack of access to healthcare services, particularly for the lower-middle class in developing nations like Indonesia, ScanVision bridges the gap between early detection and treatment. It empowers users to take proactive steps towards maintaining their eye health and supports healthcare professionals with precise, data-driven insights.
